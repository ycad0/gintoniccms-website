     * Email configuration.
     *
     * You can configure email transports and email delivery profiles here.
     *
     * By defining transports separately from delivery profiles you can easily
     * re-use transport configuration across multiple profiles.
     *
     * You can specify multiple configurations for production, development and
     * testing.
     *
     * ### Configuring transports
     *
     * Each transport needs a `className`. Valid options are as follows:
     *
     *  Mail   - Send using PHP mail function
     *  Smtp   - Send using SMTP
     *  Debug  - Do not send the email, just return the result
     *
     * You can add custom transports (or override existing transports) by adding the
     * appropriate file to src/Network/Email.  Transports should be named
     * 'YourTransport.php', where 'Your' is the name of the transport.
     *
     * ### Configuring delivery profiles
     *
     * Delivery profiles allow you to predefine various properties about email
     * messages from your application and give the settings a name. This saves
     * duplication across your application and makes maintenance and development
     * easier. Each profile accepts a number of keys. See `Cake\Network\Email\Email`
     * for more information.
